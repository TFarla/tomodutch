read time: 15 hours
enjoyment: 3 stars? I think a lot of this book is working up to a big climax considering Rudi had to leave his pregnant wife and sisters behind. I hope it'll pay off in the next book.

big events:
- Norun and Aisha came back with ruierdo
- Uses curse of the doll so nanahoshi can summon items from earth like a pet bottle
- Norun lives at the 寮 while aisha will stay a maid for Rudi after getting a perfect score for the entrance exam
- Norun becomes a 引きこもり because she hates Rudi and will never be as smart as him
- Rudi talks with Norun and they become closer. She thinks he's a lot like Paulo
- Shilfy gets pregnant
- Letter from Geez requesting for help
- Rudi and Erinazu go there using a teleportation summoning circle from nanahoshi
- They end up in the dessert and Rudi fights off his urges against succubus
- Norun and Cliff become acquainted and he offers her to help her study 

Impression:

A lot happened in this book. I thought Rudi would stay at school for longer but he's only in his second year. Bought a house, married and his wife is pregnant. While I'd love to learn more about his sisters I'd also love to read Paulo's reaction about all of this. He doesn't even know Rudi got married. I really hope Zanis is ok and they can finally reunite the family in the next chapter.
