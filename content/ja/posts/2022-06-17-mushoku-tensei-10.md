big events:
- marriage
- buy house -> creepy doll that can move on its own
- erinazu is shilfy's grandmother
- duel against luke. Maybe that's because he was in love with Shilfy?
- letter from Paulo. Rujierudo and sisters are coming to Rudi
- nanahoshi attempts suicide
- Cliff helps nanahoshi with her 研究 and they have a breakthrough 
- Norun hates Rudi because of that bar fight with Paulo
- Ruierdo talks about Alice. He urges Rudi to listen to her story next time they meet. Rudi starts to think his marriage may have been a mistake

Impression:

mushoku tensei 7, 8, 9, 10 can probably be a good season. Start with broken hearted Rudi going to the north to find his mom. Gets ED and joins the magical university in order to investigate the teleportation calamity and cure his ED. Meets Shilfy, fights the magic king, meets zanoba and cliff. Goes with shilfy to the woods where she reveals her identity and soon after they marry. In 10 a lot of it can be skipped. He buys a haunted house and discovers a doll moving through magic. Renovates the house and prepares the wedding with Silfy
