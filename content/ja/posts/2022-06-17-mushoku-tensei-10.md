big events:
- marriage
- buy house -> creepy doll that can move on its own
- erinazu is shilfy's grandmother
- duel against luke. Maybe that's because he was in love with Shilfy?

Impression:

mushoku tensei 7, 8, 9, 10 can probably be a good season. Start with broken hearted Rudi going to the north to find his mom. Gets ED and joins the magical university in order to investigate the teleportation calamity and cure his ED. Meets Shilfy, fights the magic king, meets zanoba and cliff. Goes with shilfy to the woods where she reveals her identity and soon after they marry. In 10 a lot of it can be skipped. He buys a haunted house and discovers a doll moving through magic. Renovates the house and prepares the wedding with Silfy
