big events:
- shirufi reveal -> rudi cured
- duel against magic king (bobidi) -> rudi wins and bobidi enters the school (why?)
- rudi meets another girl that has been transported to this world (was it the one that got hit by a truck?) wants to go back to earth and has 0 magic potential. A rank in the magic guild and accompanied orustedo when he attacked rudi. She is looking for 2 others and showed rudi their names and they spoke in japanese instead of the human language. rudi doesn't want to go back to earth but agrees to help her with her experiments with summoning circles
- alice summary -> becomes a sword master and gets trained by the sword god in order to fight orustedo
- rapurisu used a magic item to transfer his curse onto the spellzoku. This could work for blessings too. Maybe that will become important later

other:
- erinaruzu married -> not so interesting
- meet again with previous party
- nina trains with alice, gets a crush on her and wants to fight rudi

overall impression:
Have to admit that it was a little boring at the beginning but after that erinarizu part was over. The other earthling appeared, magic god duel, shirufi revealed and alice update. It felt really important to the over arcing plot. I wonder how roxy and paulo are doing. They were supposed to save zenisu (mom) but haven't heard anything which is kind of strange. If I were to guess then maybe they need to be saved? I would love to see the old Greyrats together again (including shirufi). It's only book 9 and it feels like I have experienced a lot with Rudi so far

remarks:

- I don't care much about the erinaruzu romance
- It's kind of strange how fast the gods get involved but I guess that's normal as Rudi is pretty strong
- Reading from shirufi's perspective was nice but it didn't feel like it added much to the story. Most of it was already in the previous book
