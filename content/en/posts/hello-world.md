My name is Thomas and I grew up in the Netherlands. I'm planning to move to Japan in 2023 and have been studying the language for 3 years with various degrees of success. In order to practice my Japanese and have a place to write about my interests I thought it'd be fun to start this blog. I'll be euphoric when I can write an excellent think piece but for the time being my articles will probably be quite small and specific so I can get the hang of this blogging thing.
