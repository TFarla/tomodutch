When I started writing this blog I figured I'd need to install a spellchecker. According to wikipedia I'm a native English speaker but unfortunately I've yet to acquire the ability to write a single article without errors. I installed the English spellchecker for my editor of choice namely visual studio code and for a reason unbeknownst to me the Esperanto variant has 233 downloads. There's a rough estimate of two million [Esperanto speakers] of which 233 felt the need like myself to install a spellchecker in visual studio code. The extension has no reviews either. I'd really like to get into contact with these 233 people and start a study about the purpose of installing an Esperanto spellchecker. Maybe Stack Overflow could include favorite "human" language in their yearly survey and ask a few questions to people who identify themselves as Esperanto speakers.

Since I don't live anywhere near an Esperanto speaking community I found a reddit post about the kinds of people who feel attracted to acquire Esperanto. Funny enough it seems that computer programmers are more inclined to do so. There's also an [UML aficionado] that calls UML the Esperanto for computer programmers. I made an effort to find some usages of Esperanto in the tech space. I've yet to find documentation for a programming language written in Esperanto but if you find one feel free to leave a comment.

## Esperanto used in tech

- [Programming in Esperanto is challenging]
- [Mozilla localization guide]
- [A proposal to use Esperanto as the default language in the Crystal programming language]
- A [few](https://github.com/mkapiczy/vetero) [projects](https://github.com/sehwoo/fali) that were named using Esperanto.

Interestingly enough the translation service [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/translator) doesn't include Esperanto while google translate does. If you're using postcss then you won't have the ability to write css in Esperanto while css keywords are translated in [many](https://github.com/Kilian/postcss-dutch-stylesheets) [other](https://github.com/ikkou/postcss-japanese-stylesheets) [languages](https://github.com/timche/postcss-german-stylesheets).

And to top it all off there's only a [single repository] on github that uses Esperanto which has 629 forks for no apparent reason because the README only states "HelperScript". Which I don't find particularly helpful at all.
