I have some free time on my hands and if I would be spending my time sitting behind a computer then I may as well do something useful. I wanted to learn some new technology so I bought some books from Humble Bundle about a variety of subjects. I'm particularly interested in Rust, data science and machine learning. My goal is not te become an academic or even an expert on these topics. I'd like to know build things with it that may make learning Japanese easier or enhance other aspects of my life. Most of all I just want to have some fun and maybe it'll turn into something others may find helpful as well.

I love schedules and planning
