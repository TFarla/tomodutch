I have some free time on my hands I wanted to learn some new technology so I bought some books from Humble Bundle about a variety of subjects. I'm particularly interested in Rust, data science and machine learning. My goal is not te become an academic or even an expert on these topics. I'd like to dabble and know how to build solutions that may make learning Japanese easier or enhance other aspects of my life. Most of all I just want to have some fun and maybe it'll turn into something others may find helpful as well. Maybe I'll end up creating the same project in different programming languages hosted in a single monorepo like the [realworld project]. I'm considering creating a single project on which I can apply what I've learned so far.

### Time tracking
I'd like to record how much time I've spend on learning certain subjects. For "human" language acquisition I'm using the [Lingo journal] app for my phone. I don't really own any of the data and it's not geared towards programming languages but I like its intuitive UI. A key feature for me are the definable goals. I'd like to spend some time studying the next few months and having clearly defined goals motivates me quite well. I'm thinking about creating an app with Flutter. I've also considered react native but like most developers pick their projects. Flutter has more stars than react native. Jokes aside, I've worked with react native in the passed and I'd just like to do something new so it will be a nice challenge to write a cross platform app with the dart programming language.

### Time frame
I don't have a concrete time frame but I'll be hosting the repositories on my github account and will write about the project whenever I feel the need to update the world.
