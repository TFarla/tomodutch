&lt;p>When I started writing this blog I figured I&amp;rsquo;d need to install a spellchecker. According to wikipedia I&amp;rsquo;m a native English speaker but unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to acquire the ability to write a single article without errors. I installed the English spellchecker for my editor of choice namely visual studio code and for a reason unbeknownst to me the Esperanto variant has 233 downloads. There&amp;rsquo;s a rough estimate of two million &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#:~:text=With%20up%20to%20two%20million,constructed%20language%20in%20the%20world.">Esperanto speakers&lt;/a> of which 233 felt the need like myself to install a spellchecker in visual studio code. The extension has no reviews either. I&amp;rsquo;d really like to get into contact with these 233 people and start a study about the purpose of installing an Esperanto spellchecker. Maybe Stack Overflow could include favorite &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; language in their yearly survey and ask a few questions to people who identify themselves as Esperanto speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I don&amp;rsquo;t live anywhere near an Esperanto speaking community I found a reddit post about the kinds of people who feel attracted to acquire Esperanto. Funny enough it seems that computer programmers are more inclined to do so. There&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;a href="https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2020/04/06/is-uml-esperanto-for-programmers/">UML aficionado&lt;/a> that calls UML the Esperanto for computer programmers. I made an effort to find some usages of Esperanto in the tech space. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to find documentation for a programming language written in Esperanto but if you find one feel free to leave a comment.&lt;/p>

Esperanto used in tech

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/styleguides/eo/">Mozilla localization guide&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/2394">A proposal to use Esperanto as the default language in the Crystal programming language&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkapiczy/vetero">few&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/sehwoo/fali">projects&lt;/a> that were named using Esperanto.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Interestingly enough the translation service &lt;a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">deepl.com&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t include Esperanto while google translate does. If you&amp;rsquo;re using postcss then you won&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to write css in Esperanto while css keywords are translated in &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kilian/postcss-dutch-stylesheets">many&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/ikkou/postcss-japanese-stylesheets">other&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/timche/postcss-german-stylesheets">languages&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to top it all off there&amp;rsquo;s only a &lt;a href="https://github.com/trending?spoken_language_code=eo">single repository&lt;/a> on github that uses Esperanto which has 629 forks for no apparent reason because the README only states &amp;ldquo;HelperScript&amp;rdquo;. Which I don&amp;rsquo;t find particularly helpful at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://tomodutch.com/en-us/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Thomas</author><guid>https://tomodutch.com/en-us/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>
&lt;p>My name is Thomas and I grew up in the Netherlands. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to move to Japan in 2023 and have been studying the language for 3 years with various degrees of success. In order to practice my Japanese and have a place to write about my interests I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to start this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll be euphoric when I can write an excellent think piece but for the time being my articles will probably be quite small and specific so I can get the hang of this blogging thing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
