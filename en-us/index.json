According to wikipedia I\u0026rsquo;m a native English speaker but unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to acquire the ability to write a single article without errors. I installed the English spellchecker for my editor of choice namely visual studio code and for a reason unbeknownst to me the Esperanto variant has 233 downloads. There\u0026rsquo;s a rough estimate of two million Esperanto speakers of which 233 felt the need like myself to install a spellchecker in visual studio code. The extension has no reviews either. I\u0026rsquo;d really like to get into contact with these 233 people and start a study about the purpose of installing an Esperanto spellchecker. Maybe Stack Overflow could include favorite \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; language in their yearly survey and ask a few questions to people who identify themselves as Esperanto speakers.\nSince I don\u0026rsquo;t live anywhere near an Esperanto speaking community I found a reddit post about the kinds of people who feel attracted to acquire Esperanto. Funny enough it seems that computer programmers are more inclined to do so. There\u0026rsquo;s also an UML aficionado that calls UML the Esperanto for computer programmers. I made an effort to find some usages of Esperanto in the tech space. I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to find documentation for a programming language written in Esperanto but if you find one feel free to leave a comment.\n   Esperanto used in tech   Programming in Esperanto is challenging Mozilla localization guide A proposal to use Esperanto as the default language in the Crystal programming language A few projects that were named using Esperanto.  Interestingly enough the translation service deepl.com doesn\u0026rsquo;t include Esperanto while google translate does. If you\u0026rsquo;re using postcss then you won\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to write css in Esperanto while css keywords are translated in many other languages.\nAnd to top it all off there\u0026rsquo;s only a single repository on github that uses Esperanto which has 629 forks for no apparent reason because the README only states \u0026ldquo;HelperScript\u0026rdquo;. Which I don\u0026rsquo;t find particularly helpful at all.\n","date":"May 27","permalink":"https://tomodutch.com/en-us/posts/2022-05-27-spell-checkers-and-esperanto/","tags":["tech","vscode","observations"],"title":"Spellcheckers in Visual Studio Code and the rare usage of Esperanto in tech"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My name is Thomas and I grew up in the Netherlands. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to move to Japan in 2023 and have been studying the language for 3 years with various degrees of success. In order to practice my Japanese and have a place to write about my interests I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be fun to start this blog. I\u0026rsquo;ll be euphoric when I can write an excellent think piece but for the time being my articles will probably be quite small and specific so I can get the hang of this blogging thing.\n","date":"May 13","permalink":"https://tomodutch.com/en-us/posts/hello-world/","tags":["blog"],"title":"Introduction"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://tomodutch.com/en-us/articles/","tags":null,"title":"Articles"}]
